# Introduction to Computation for the Physical Sciences

### Hello!  

The files in this repo comprise syllabus, tutorial notebooks, and data files from **PHY 220** *Introduction to Computation for the Physical Sciences* at Washington & Jefferson College.
These materials build on a computational physics laboratory course that was offered annually from 2014 to 2021.
PHY 220 was first offered as a stand-alone course in the Spring 2022 semester, and will be taught annually thereafter.
Files in this repository should be updated at least as frequently as the course is taught until they achieve educational and literary perfection.

### Audience

PHY 220 is required of all physics and engineering students in their first or second years of study.  The course is also intended for students majoring in chemistry, biology, mathematics, economics, or any other field where intermediate quantitative literacy and basic programming skills related to data science could be an asset.  These materials use `python`, but the skills and structure of the course could easily ported to other prominent languages provided they have some workable graphing capabilities.  

Some students who take PHY 220 have some (and in some cases extensive) prior programming experience. For a significant fraction of our students, however, PHY 220 is their first experience using a computer outside of the MS Office suite.

### Philosophy and goals

The course takes a "software carpentry" approach, covering several types of techniques in a way that builds "capability" rather than "proficiency" or "expertise".  For example, after taking the course, a student might not be able to sit down and independently bang out an Euler algorithm for a second-order partial differential equation, but she should be able to do some light Googling, read other people's code, and cobble together an Euler implementation that works for her particular application.  This early skills approach is part of a larger effort in the department to prepare students for meaningful research and internships as early as possible in the college career.

In the Physics Major at W&J, these skills are reinforced and expanded on in courses in the third and fourth year of study.

### Course structure

Ideally this course will meet weekly or twice weekly for a combined 180 minutes.  Each week of class centers on a new skill or set of skills
